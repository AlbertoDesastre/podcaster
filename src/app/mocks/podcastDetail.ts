Seriously, not since 1958 have we seen so many country tunes topping the Hot 100 in a single year – and it\'s not been without its share of controversy. Leading this country music revival? Morgan Wallen, for starters. He bounced back from being shunned for dropping a racial slur with his number one single “Last Night.” Then there\'s Jason Aldean with “Try That in a Small Town,” a song and music video that which unsubtly lynching references. Next up, newcomer Oliver Anthony Music dropped “Richmond North of Richmond,” weaving in QAnon references and welfare shaming into a track largely about government distrust. On a lighter but still contentious note, Luke Combs covered the mega 90s hit “Fast Car,” turning Tracy Chapman into the first black woman with a number one country hit. And let\'s not forget Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves\' beautiful duet “I Remember Everything” about a past romance, which also climbed to the top. Many of these songs have just been nominated for Grammys, including “Last Night,” “Fast Car,” and “I Remember Everything.”\\n\\nWhen all this started happening, we were scratching our heads. Country songs topping the Hot 100? Sure, but not this many in quick succession. Something felt different. And we think we\'ve finally figured it out after diving into Chris Molanphy\'s new book: Old Town Road. Chris, a music and charts critic, author of Slate’s Why Is This Song No. 1 column, and host of the excellent music podcast Hit Parade, explores country music\'s chart history in his latest book “Old Town Road,” part of Duke\'s Single Series. He zeroes in on Lil Nas X\'s 2018 “Old Town Road” and its 2019 Billy Ray Cyrus-amped remix as a case study. So, to get the lowdown on 2023\'s country chart toppers, we\'ve got to rewind to 2018 and re-examine “Old Town Road” with Chris Molanphy\'s insights.\\n\\nSONGS DISCUSSED\\n\\nLil Nas X - Old Town Road\\n\\nLil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus - Old Town Road remix\\n\\nMorgan Waller - Last Night\\n\\nJason Aldean - Try That In A Small Town\\n\\nOliver Anthony Music - Rich Men North of Richmond\\n\\nLuke Combs - Fast Car\\n\\nZach Bryan, Kacey Musgraves - I Remember Everything \\n\\nLil Nas X - Sonic Shit\\n\\nNine Inch Nails - 34 Ghosts IV\\n\\nBilly Ray Cyrus - Achy Breaky Heart\\n\\nLuke Bryan - Light It Up\\n\\nMorgan Wallen - Thinking’ Bout Me\\n\\nJason Aldean - Burnin’ It Down \\n\\nDeFord Bailey - Fox Chase\\n\\nCarter Family - Can The Circle Be Unbroken \\n\\nBill Monroe - Mule Skinner Blues \\n\\nHank Williams - Wealth Won’t Save Your Soul \\n\\nRay Charles - You Are My Sunshine\\n\\nPine Ridge Boys - You Are My Sunshine\\n\\nPatsy Cline - Crazy \\n\\nLionel Richie - Stuck On You \\n\\nBlano Brown - The Git Up \\n\\n\\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Was this new song be another gimmick like the fake Drake hit \\"Heart on My Sleeve\\"? No. Instead, the Beatles simply used AI voice separation technology to repair a well-worn John Lennon demo tape. \\n\\nBack in the \'90s, Yoko Ono gave shared a collection of unfinished John Lennon demos with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison (who died in 2001) as part of a final recording session that resulted in the singles \\"Free As a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love.\\" However, the third song, “Now And Then\\" was marred by hissing and humming, and the piano was overly loud. Harrison called it rubbish, and after a few hours of tracking a rough song they left it on the cutting room floor. \\n\\nBut now in 2023, using film maker Peter Jackson’s latest restoration technology created for his \\"Get Back\\" documentary, the Beatles were able to create one last song together, though in three different eras. Lennon tracked his vocals in the \'70s, Harrison\'s parts were lifted from the \'90s sessions, and McCartney and Starr added their parts in 2022. The band is filled out by a string arrangement by Giles Martin (Beatles cataloger and son of the late Beatles producer George Martin) and Ben Foster, in addition to reused backing vocals from earlier Beatles tracks. \\n\\nSo, did the Beatles successfully bring this worn-out recording back to life? Does this AI song sound like Beatles, let alone human?

So, rather than do a story on that, Charlie and Nate take a look at the brand new TikTok Billboard Top 50 chart, established only last month.\\n\\nThis chart – which measures the most popular songs on the platform through each song’s number of videos, views, and user engagement – perhaps best shows the things that are popular and pervasive among a contingent of younger music listeners.

The film finds the band — Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, David Byrne and Jerry Harrison — at the height of their powers over three successive nights at the the Hollywood Pantages Theater. As Chris and Tina remembered it when they spoke to producer Reanna Cruz, \\"We\'d reached a state in our career and our lives when we felt, \'we\'ve gotten pretty good at this now. We can show the world.\'\\"\\nDirector Jonathan Demme spliced the band\'s performances into an eighty-eight minute odyssey beginning with Byrne solo on the stage and gradually bringing in the rest of the band and a cast of stellar guest musicians: vocalists Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, percussionist Steve Scales, and guitarist Alex Weir. The film introduced landmark moments like Byrne’s big suit, Demme’s cinematic approach to concert cinematography, Chris\'s and Tina’s Tom Tom Club performing the perennial sample flip \\"Genius of Love,\\" and a theater-rocking version of \\"Burning Down the House.\\" Stop Making Sense broke the mold of concert films and created a new paradigm for artists to follow ever since.\\nNate, Charlie, and Reanna take insights from Reanna\'s conversation with Tina and Chris on the legacy of Stop Making Sense as a guide to think through our own favorite concert movies — the Band\'s The Last Waltz, Madonna\'s Truth or Dare, and Beyonce\'s Homecoming — to identify the musical and visual choices that make them so indelible.\\n\\nSongs Discussed\\nTalking Heads - This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) - Live\\nTalking Heads - Burning Down the House - Live\\nBeyoncé - Diva - Homecoming Live\\nBeyoncé - Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) - Homecoming Live\\nMadonna - Express Yourself\\nMadonna - Live to Tell\\nThe Band - The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down - Live\\nThe Band - I Shall Be Released (Finale) - Live\\nLearn more about your ad choices.
